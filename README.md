WHAT IS A HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM?

A hotel management system enables customers and employees to book and tour ahotel, as well as manage the workings and functionalities of the same, all through a virtual online medium without having to be physically present. 
  The benefits of remote communication, work, and so on are self-explanatory in the post-COVID era. 
  Unlike in the past, we no longer need to 'physically' visit the hotel in order to book/tour it. 
  The advancement and development that have occurred in recent years in the domains and subdomains of IT have enabled us to bridge the gap between things that were previously very present due to the physical distance between two concerned entities. 
  The Hotel Management System has grown in popularity in recent years, and it also serves as a catalyst in catapulting a hotel's marketing and thus its customer reach. The more successful a hotel's growth trajectory, the better the hotel management system.
